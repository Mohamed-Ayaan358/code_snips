<h1><pre>Code_snips               (Created at 2021-05-16)</pre></h1>
 - A collection of helpful code snippets(maximum of 70-60 lines). I have made that can be used for larger programs. 

 - I made this project about 2 months back believing that it would be great for sharing codes with other people.
 
 - Open for users to contribute to the codebase so as to help each other out. Algorithms,Object detection algorithms,machine learning algorithms to basic templates and short codes to allow for creation of web-page elements this codebase welcomes all and I hope that others will see the use of such a repository.
 - The plan is to have helpful snippets of code which others can contribute to as well pull in order to improve their codes:
  1. These code_snips can be used for training models in githib copilot
  2. The centering of webpages as well as background settings as well animations for web dev
  3. Models for AI/ML repositories
  4. Helpful Python scripts whoch can be conjoined with main codes to accomplish a task.
  5. You can directly put pull requests than raising an issue.
 
 


 - If you wish to contribute several code files related to one another please do put these codes into a zip file.

NOTE:
<h2>This might seem that I am trying for a low effort repository but I do believe this can be helpful to others and thought the best way to get more snips is by putting it up here.
Your PR's will be srutanised and will be accepted based on usefullness, at the moment we are accepting a limited number of issues</h2>


### Examples of low quailty contributions

+ Pull requests that are automated e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace / fix typos / optimize images.

+ Pull requests that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request.

+ Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.

+ Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.

+ Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.
