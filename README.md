<h1>Code_snips</h1>
  
 - A collection of helpful code snippets.I have made that can be used for larger programs. 
 
 - Open for users to contribute to the codebase so as to help each other out.Algorithms, Object detection algorithms,machine learning algorithms for AI/ML.
 - Basic templates and short codes to allow for creation of web-page elements as well as larger python scripts.
 - For example:-
 1. The text_to_speech and speech_to_text codes can be used in a website so as to allow hearing impaired individuals to communicate their thoughts.
 2. This can be inserted into a larger codebase for a larger set of individuals with different disabilities.
 3. This could also used in websites so as to add extra functionality and cool features.
### Parameters (Mandatory) :-
<hr>

1.If you are submitting an AI/Model then you must specify the efficiency of the models.

2.Length of the code must not be lesser than 20 lines or greater than 200 lines unless explained to the maintainer why the code is in the spirit of this repository.

3.Must include Sufficient comments on your code for others to understand your script.

4.Also at the end of the file in comments please do indicate the uses of your script.

### How to contribute:-
<hr>
1. Identify and raise an issue or ask to be assigned to a present issue.

2. Fork the project

3. Perform **git clone** on your fork and perform the changes on your local system.

4. Enter **git** add your relevant files then enter **git commit -m "You message"**.

5. Finally enter **git push**.

6. Then go to github and press the contribute button to raise a pull request.

7. Wait untill a reviewer sees your code and changes to the code.

### Examples of low quailty contributions:-
<hr>
Note that your PR's will be scrutanised heavily if they follow the parameters and is limited to one PR per participant.

+ Pull requests that are automated e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace / fix typos / optimize images.

+ Pull requests that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request.

+ Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.

+ Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.

+ Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.
