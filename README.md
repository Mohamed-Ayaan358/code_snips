<h1>Code_snips</h1>
  
 - A collection of helpful code snippets.I have made that can be used for larger programs. 
 
 - Open for users to contribute to the codebase so as to help each other out.Algorithms, Object detection algorithms,machine learning algorithms to basic templates and short codes to allow for creation of web-page elements this codebase welcomes all codes and I hope that others will see the use of such a repository.

### Examples of low quailty contributions:-
<hr>
Note that your PR's will be scrutanised heavily if they follow the parameters and is limited to one PR per participant.

+ Pull requests that are automated e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace / fix typos / optimize images.

+ Pull requests that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request.

+ Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.

+ Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.

+ Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.
